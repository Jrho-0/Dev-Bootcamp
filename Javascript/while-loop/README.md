## Loops

Loops can execute a block of code as long as a specified condition is true.

### The While Loop

While something is true, the computer runs the code again and again untill the statement is no longer true.

Syntax

while (i < 2) `{
    console.log(i);
    i++;  
}`

//The block of code above stops running when i = 2, since 2 < 2.
