## CSS
CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

### Ways to Insert CSS

#### There are three ways of inserting a style sheet:

+ Inline CSS: inside an HTML element, used to apply a unique style for a single element.
+ Internal CSS: The internal style is defined inside the `<style>` element, inside the head section.
+ External CSS: 
External styles are defined within the `<link>` element, inside the `<head>` section of an HTML page. (i,e `<link rel="stylesheet" type="css/stylesheet" href="./style.css">`)

inline style has the highest priority, and will override external and internal styles and browser defaults.

 ### CSS Selectors

+ CSS selectors are used to "find" (or select) the HTML elements you want to style.

**We can divide CSS selectors into five categories:**

+ Simple selectors (select elements based on name, id, class)
+ Combinator selectors (select elements based on a specific relationship between them)
+ Pseudo-class selectors (select elements based on a certain state)
+ Pseudo-elements selectors (select and style a part of an element)
+ Attribute selectors (select elements based on an attribute or attribute value)
